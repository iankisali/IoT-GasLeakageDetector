# IoT-GasLeakageDetector

Repo for an IoT-based Gas Leakage Detector using Arduino Uno, ESP8266 Node MCU and using a cloud platform.

## Initial Documentation. Will be updated

## Challenges Encountered

- My ESP8266MOD wasn't recognizable with Arduino IDE. ESP used is CP2102 (look up on the small chip near USB input). Solved this by downloading appropriate OS drivers from [Silicon Labs VCP Drivers Download](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) and it was recognizable from IDE. Remember to specify the port from IDE. **[Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9DqQV9rOJM)** for youtube tutorial explaining process for drivers installation in detail.
